# Portfolio 1 Course Assignment

Goal
As a developer it's often a good idea to re-visit work and solutions along the way. Developers are constantly growing in experience and understanding of languages and tasks, so it is essential that you self-assess and make improvements.

Brief
In this assignment, you are will present three submissions from the first year: your cross-course project, Semester Project 1, and Project Exam 1.
You should make improvements to all three submissions based on your own self-assessment as well as feedback from tutors. You might not have received feedback on the Project Exam 1 yet, but you can still make improvements and changes (perhaps attempt the level 2 process?).

Any updates to the Project Exam 1 must be done on a new repository. Do not update the repository you have submitted for grading, but copy the files to a new repository.

The three projects will be presented on a portfolio page where you will link to the three updated projects as well as list what changes have been made and why you decided to make them. The portfolio page will form part of your assessment, both from a design and technical perspective. You should link to the deployed site as well as its GitHub repo.

Level 1 Process
Look back over your three submissions and evaluate what changes and updates you could make. For example, for the Semester Project 1, you hadnâ€™t covered JavaScript yet. How can you add JavaScript to enhance the website or use concepts in Interaction Design concepts to improve the user experience? You can go above and beyond the brief.

Make the changes to the three projects. Ensure updates for Project Exam 1 go in a different repository to the one submitted for marking.
Create a portfolio page with links to the three projects. You can host the portfolio page on your web host or on Netlify.
Submit a link to the portfolio page.
